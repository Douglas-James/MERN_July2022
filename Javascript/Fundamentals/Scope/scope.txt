What is Scope?
Has type of scope: Global and Local. New scope are created by
definining functions.


Global Scope
onminpresent, which means that any variables or functions defined
are aviable to every aspect of your applications





Local Scope
Has a narrower program visibility, it has a particular function in which that information
is defined is only access inside that function


Identifying Scope
var beatles = ['Paul', 'George', 'John', 'Ringo']; Global variables


function printNames(names) 
{
  function actuallyPrintingNames() 
  {
    for (var index = 0; index < names.length; index++) 
    {
      var name = names[index];
  
      console.log(name + ' was found at index ' + index);
    }
    console.log('name and index after loop is ' + name + ':' + index);
  }
  actuallyPrintingNames(); // new function that can be called here in this
  function
}
printNames(beatles);

every thing has access to that array
                     




Const and Let
ES6 we got two new ways of declare variables.
It is used scope information more precisely to individual, is know as 
block scoping. A code block is called like this {}.

Const: Need a value at creation and value can't be change for the 
life of that variable.It is immutable

Let: Allows for reassignment of our declaration, doesn't 
require a value upon declaration.
